      Lets talk variables : A variable is a container for holding program data
      A variable can be any word or alpha-numeric characters , but must not begin with a number or weird symbol.

      In Js , a variable is created by writing its declaraton and name

      By default every variable that is not storing(not assigned a value) any data 
      holds an undefined value

      To store data in a variable you must assign a value using the equal sign operator "="

      However , variable declaration and value assignment can be done in one line of code
    */ 

    var myFirst ; // The "var" is the declaration and the "myFirst" is the variable name
    myFirst="I love God" // Here the variable myFirst has been assigned a value "I love God"

    console.log(myFirst)
